## Liquidity Management

To ensure market stability and safeguard Spiral's token price, the liquidity pool (LP) will be managed responsibly with allocations directly aligned to token unlock schedules and expected trading activity.

### Main Objectives
- **Stability**: The LP provides liquidity for buyers and sellers, reducing volatility and ensuring a healthy market.
- **Responsibility**: Treasury-funded LPs ensure no additional burden on investors while stabilizing early trading phases.
- **Growth**: A well-funded LP encourages trading activity and confidence, driving demand for the Spiral token.

---

### Initial LP Setup
A proposal for the initial LP to be funded from the treasury.

- **Treasury-Backed Liquidity**:
  - Both SPL and ICP tokens for the LP are funded by the treasury, ensuring no additional burden is placed on investors.
  - The treasury allocates a specific percentage of its reserves to support liquidity during the first year of token unlocks.

- **Initial LP Allocation**:
  - A robust initial allocation is made, comprising **10-25% of the total ICP raised**, paired with SPL tokens from the treasury.
  - This ensures the LP meets projected market demand during the early stages.

- **Quarterly Reassessments**:
  - Trading volumes and market behavior are monitored each quarter to dynamically adjust LP contributions.
  - This flexibility allows the treasury to respond to market conditions and maintain stability.

### Matching Unlocks with LP Requirements

The vesting schedule is designed to align with liquidity needs, ensuring that token unlocks are supported by adequate LP funding.

#### **1. DFINITY Allocation**
- **Foundational**: We don’t expect DFINITY to sell our tokens, though they have the discretion to do so if needed. Instead, we see this allocation as a way to provide guidance in governance, ensuring Cosmicrafts stays aligned with the foundational values of the Internet Computer.

#### **2. Team Allocation**
- **Locked Neurons**: 
  - **80% of team tokens** are permanently locked in non-dissolving neurons, ensuring no market impact from this portion.
  - This demonstrates long-term commitment and alignment with the project's success.
- **Quarterly Unlocks**: 
  - The remaining **20% of team tokens** are released quarterly after a **1-year cliff**, at a rate of **625,000 SPL per quarter**.
  - This measured release matches LP growth, avoiding market flooding.

#### **3. Seed Investors**
- **Cliff Period**: A **3-month cliff** provides an initial buffer before token unlocks begin.
- **Quarterly Releases**: Tokens are unlocked in increments of **12,500,000 SPL** per quarter, spreading the impact over time.
- **Treasury Support**: LP contributions from the treasury absorb sales pressure, ensuring market stability during these releases.

#### **4. SNS Sale Participants**
- **No Cliff**: Tokens are unlocked immediately, allowing SNS participants access to liquidity.
- **Quarterly Releases**: **25,000,000 SPL** tokens are released each quarter for 2 years.
- **Dynamic Matching**: Treasury LP contributions are adjusted quarterly to match trading volumes, stabilizing the market.


### How Liquidity Aligns with Token Unlocks
- **Unlock Schedule**: Spiral tokens are released quarterly based on a structured vesting plan.
- **Market Volume Estimate**: On average, 10%~25% of unlocked tokens are expected to trade each quarter.
- **Liquidity Provision**: The LP is funded to match the expected trading volume to stabilize the market.


#### Example: Q1 Liquidity Pairing

- **Token Price**: $0.01
- **Unlocked Tokens**: 25,000,000 SPL
- **Expected Trading Volume**: 5,000,000 SPL (25% of unlocked tokens)
- **LP Contribution**:
  - SPL: 5,000,000 SPL from the treasury
  - ICP: 5,000 ICP (to pair with SPL at $0.01)

## Tokenomics Mechanics

### 1. Deflationary Design

To maintain scarcity and drive long-term value, Spiral incorporates **deflationary mechanisms** designed to remove tokens from circulation sustainably. These mechanisms are tailored to the infrastructure of our games and platforms, while leveraging the capabilities of the SNS, NNS, and ICP ecosystem.

---

#### **Specific Burning Mechanisms**

1. **Transaction Fee Burns**
   - Each Spiral transaction incurs a **fixed fee** (e.g., 0.1 Spiral) that is permanently burned, reducing the overall supply.  
   - This ensures regular usage of Spiral consistently contributes to token scarcity.  

2. **Microtransaction Burns (Games and Platforms)**
   - In-game microtransactions paid in Spiral will include a burning mechanism:  
     - **10% of the Spiral payment** is burned.  
     - The remaining 90% is sent to the DAO treasury to provide **staking rewards (maturity)** for Spiral holders.  
   - This applies to activities like upgrading NFTs, crafting items, or purchasing in-game goods, directly linking token utility to deflation.

3. **Marketplace Integration Burns**
   - For Spiral-based transactions in third-party marketplaces, the fee recipient address can be configured as a contract with the following behavior:
     - **10% of the fee is burned** permanently.
     - The remaining 90% is sent to the DAO treasury.  
   - This ensures a consistent burn rate for transactions while providing additional staking rewards for the community.  

4. **Utility-Driven Token Burns**
   - Burns will be incentivized by increasing Spiral’s **utility** within the ecosystem, encouraging token holders to use Spiral for:  
     - **NFT upgrades**: Upgrading items, skins, or abilities that require Spiral, burning a fixed portion of the cost.  
     - **Exclusive Access**: Unlocking premium game content or limited-time events where a portion of the Spiral used is burned.  
   - This approach removes tokens from circulation through increased demand and engagement.  

5. **Event-Based Burning Campaigns**
   - Host **special events or challenges** where users voluntarily spend Spiral on in-game activities or community goals, with a portion burned.  
   - Examples:  
     - Seasonal upgrades or recipes that burn higher Spiral amounts.  
     - Community milestones where collective Spiral usage unlocks rewards while burning tokens.  

---

#### **Focus on Circulating Supply**
- Unlike treasury burns, which affect non-circulating supply, these mechanisms are designed to actively remove tokens **already in circulation**.
- This ensures that Spiral’s deflationary design is effective in maintaining scarcity and increasing its value as usage grows.  


### 2. Staking and Governance Rewards

- **Maturity-Based Rewards**:
  - Rewards increase with the length of time Spiral tokens are staked, incentivizing long-term commitment.
- **Non-Minting Rewards**:
  - Staking and governance rewards are sourced from the DAO Treasury, avoiding inflationary pressure on the total supply.

### 3. Multi-Game Integration

Spiral operates as the backbone of Cosmicrafts’ interconnected gaming ecosystem:

- **Cross-Game Currency**:
  - Players use Spiral for transactions, upgrades, and premium content across all Cosmicrafts titles.
- **Interoperable Assets**:
  - Spiral enables NFTs and other digital assets to retain utility across multiple games, enhancing their value and versatility.
