## Tokenomics Mechanics

### 1. Deflationary Design:
- **Burning Mechanisms**:
  - A portion of transaction fees for Spiral purchases and transfers is burned, reducing token supply over time.
- **Game Economy Burns**:
  - Fees from in-game activities (e.g., marketplace trades, crafting accelerations) contribute to supply reduction.

### 2. Staking and Governance Rewards:
- **Maturity-Based Rewards**:
  - Rewards increase with neuron age, encouraging long-term commitment.
- **Non-Minting Rewards**:
  - Rewards are allocated from the DAO treasury, ensuring no inflationary pressure on Spiral’s supply.

### 3. Multi-Game Integration:
- **Unified Economy**:
  - All games in the Cosmicrafts franchise operate on Spiral, ensuring consistent utility and value across the ecosystem.
- **Interoperable Assets**:
  - Spiral can unlock cross-game features like transferable NFTs and franchise-wide events.

## Security and Stability

To ensure a secure and fair ecosystem, the following measures are implemented:

### 1. Whale Mitigation:
- **Voting Caps**:
  - Limits the influence of large token holders to ensure balanced decision-making.
- **Reputation System**:
  - Rewards consistent, meaningful participation, offsetting raw token quantity.

### 2. Voter Engagement:
- **Participation Incentives**:
  - Bonus rewards for regular governance participation.
- **Clear Communication**:
  - Notifications and updates about upcoming votes to keep stakeholders engaged.

### 3. Smart Contract Security:
- **Immutable Token Contract**:
  - The Spiral token’s canister is “blackholed,” preventing post-deployment modifications.
- **Audits**:
  - Third-party audits are conducted on all governance and treasury-related smart contracts.
- **Multi-Sig Treasury Management**:
  - Sensitive treasury actions require multiple authorized signatories, reducing the risk of malicious activity.

### 4. Mitigation of Hostile Takeovers:
- **Stakeholder Protection**:
  - Voting power is influenced by dissolve delay and neuron age, encouraging long-term commitment over short-term manipulation.
- **Emergency Protocols**:
  - Critical proposals threatening the DAO’s stability can be paused for community review.
