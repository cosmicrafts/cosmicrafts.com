## Vesting Periods

To ensure long-term commitment and alignment with project goals, Spiral tokens are subject to structured vesting schedules. Below are the key details:

![SNS Vesting Periods](VestingPeriod.webp)

- **DFINITY Allocation**: 
  - Tokens are locked under a **6 month cliff period**, gradually disbursed each year over the course of 8 years. 
  - Each year, 3,125,000 SPL tokens are released for DFINITY, neuron dissolving is at DFINITY's own discretion.

- **Team Allocation**: 
  - 80% Tokens are permanent locked in a 8 year non dissolving neuron. 
  - The remaining 20% of Team tokens have **1 year cliff period**, gradually disbursed each quarter. 
  - Each quarter, 625,000 SPL tokens are released, ensuring measured and responsible distribution.

- **Seed Investors**: 
  - Tokens are quarterly released in increments of **12,500,000 SPL** after an **initial 3 month cliff** period.

- **SNS Sale Participants**: 
  - Tokens allocated during the sale are released in quarters, **without cliff** starting with **25,000,000 SPL** at each disbursement period for 2 years.

- **Key Milestones**: 
  - Responsible vesting periods to provide room to react against expected market demand.
  - Match unlocks with LPs allocation.

This systematic approach balances rewards for early contributors while maintaining project stability and trustworthiness.

## Liquidity Management

To ensure market stability and safeguard Spiral's token price, the liquidity pool (LP) will be managed responsibly with allocations directly aligned to token unlock schedules and expected trading activity.

### Main Objectives
- **Stability**: The LP provides liquidity for buyers and sellers, reducing volatility and ensuring a healthy market.
- **Responsibility**: Treasury-funded LPs ensure no additional burden on investors while stabilizing early trading phases.
- **Growth**: A well-funded LP encourages trading activity and confidence, driving demand for the Spiral token.

---

### Initial LP Setup
A proposal for the initial LP to be funded from the treasury.

- **Treasury-Backed Liquidity**:
  - Both SPL and ICP tokens for the LP are funded by the treasury, ensuring no additional burden is placed on investors.
  - The treasury allocates a specific percentage of its reserves to support liquidity during the first year of token unlocks.

- **Initial LP Allocation**:
  - A robust initial allocation is made, comprising **10-25% of the total ICP raised**, paired with SPL tokens from the treasury.
  - This ensures the LP meets projected market demand during the early stages.

- **Quarterly Reassessments**:
  - Trading volumes and market behavior are monitored each quarter to dynamically adjust LP contributions.
  - This flexibility allows the treasury to respond to market conditions and maintain stability.

---

### Matching Unlocks with LP Requirements

The vesting schedule is designed to align with liquidity needs, ensuring that token unlocks are supported by adequate LP funding.

#### **1. DFINITY Allocation**
- **Foundational**: We don’t expect DFINITY to sell our tokens, though they have the discretion to do so if needed. Instead, we see this allocation as a way to provide guidance in governance, ensuring Cosmicrafts stays aligned with the foundational values of the Internet Computer.

#### **2. Team Allocation**
- **Locked Neurons**: 
  - **80% of team tokens** are permanently locked in non-dissolving neurons, ensuring no market impact from this portion.
  - This demonstrates long-term commitment and alignment with the project's success.
- **Quarterly Unlocks**: 
  - The remaining **20% of team tokens** are released quarterly after a **1-year cliff**, at a rate of **625,000 SPL per quarter**.
  - This measured release matches LP growth, avoiding market flooding.

#### **3. Seed Investors**
- **Cliff Period**: A **3-month cliff** provides an initial buffer before token unlocks begin.
- **Quarterly Releases**: Tokens are unlocked in increments of **12,500,000 SPL** per quarter, spreading the impact over time.
- **Treasury Support**: LP contributions from the treasury absorb sales pressure, ensuring market stability during these releases.

#### **4. SNS Sale Participants**
- **No Cliff**: Tokens are unlocked immediately, allowing SNS participants access to liquidity.
- **Quarterly Releases**: **25,000,000 SPL** tokens are released each quarter for 2 years.
- **Dynamic Matching**: Treasury LP contributions are adjusted quarterly to match trading volumes, stabilizing the market.


### How Liquidity Aligns with Token Unlocks
- **Unlock Schedule**: Spiral tokens are released quarterly based on a structured vesting plan.
- **Market Volume Estimate**: On average, 10%~25% of unlocked tokens are expected to trade each quarter.
- **Liquidity Provision**: The LP is funded to match the expected trading volume to stabilize the market.


#### Example: Q1 Liquidity Pairing

- **Token Price**: $0.01
- **Unlocked Tokens**: 25,000,000 SPL
- **Expected Trading Volume**: 5,000,000 SPL (25% of unlocked tokens)
- **LP Contribution**:
  - SPL: 5,000,000 SPL from the treasury
  - ICP: 5,000 ICP (to pair with SPL at $0.01)

Spiral enables a decentralized governance model, granting stakeholders direct control over Cosmicrafts’ future.

- **Proposal Submission**: Stakeholders can propose updates, new game modes, expansions, or partnerships by submitting a small Spiral deposit to deter spam.
- **Voting Power**: Weighted by the amount of Spiral staked, neuron age (how long it’s been staked), and dissolve delay (commitment period).
- **Governance Rewards**: Active participation in voting earns Spiral rewards, incentivizing consistent engagement.

### 2. Gaming Economy: Enhancing Player Experience

## Tokenomics Mechanics

### 1. Deflationary Design

To maintain scarcity and long-term value, Spiral incorporates deflationary mechanisms:

- **Burning Mechanisms**:
  - A portion of transaction fees (e.g., transfers, marketplace sales) is burned, permanently reducing token supply.
  - Example: *For every 100 Spiral tokens used in a transaction, 2 tokens are burned.*

- **In-Game Economy Burns**:
  - Fees from in-game activities such as crafting, upgrades, or marketplace trades are burned to sustain token scarcity.

### 2. Staking and Governance Rewards

- **Maturity-Based Rewards**:
  - Rewards increase with the length of time Spiral tokens are staked, incentivizing long-term commitment.
- **Non-Minting Rewards**:
  - Staking and governance rewards are sourced from the Community Treasury, avoiding inflationary pressure on the total supply.

### 3. Multi-Game Integration

Spiral operates as the backbone of Cosmicrafts’ interconnected gaming ecosystem:

- **Cross-Game Currency**:
  - Players use Spiral for transactions, upgrades, and premium content across all Cosmicrafts titles.
- **Interoperable Assets**:
  - Spiral enables NFTs and other digital assets to retain utility across multiple games, enhancing their value and versatility.

## Security and Stability

Spiral’s design incorporates safeguards to ensure a secure, stable, and fair deal for all participants.


### 1. Smart Contract Security

- **Immutable Token Contracts**: Spiral’s canisters are "blackholed," ensuring they cannot be tampered with post-deployment.
- **Audits**: Regular third-party audits are conducted to maintain the integrity of governance and treasury smart contracts.

### 2. Voter Engagement

- **Participation Incentives**: Additional rewards for active governance participation.
- **Clear Communication**: Regular updates and notifications about proposals and voting timelines.
- **Reputation System**: Rewards consistent participation, reducing the impact of large, passive stakeholders.
