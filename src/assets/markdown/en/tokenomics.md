## Spiral Utility: Driving Engagement and Ecosystem Growth

### Governance: Empowering Stakeholders

## Tokenomics Mechanisms: Ensuring Long-Term Value

### Deflationary Mechanisms
- **Burning Mechanisms**: A percentage of transaction fees and in-game fees will be burned, reducing token supply over time and enhancing scarcity.

### Staking and Governance Rewards
- **Non-Minting Rewards**: Rewards are sourced from the Community Treasury, avoiding inflationary pressures.
- **Maturity-Based Rewards**: Long-term stakers earn greater rewards, incentivizing sustained engagement.

### Interoperable Ecosystem
- **Cross-Game Functionality**: Spiral facilitates asset use and utility across the Cosmicrafts franchise. For instance, **a spaceship NFT earned in one game might provide a speed boost in another Cosmicrafts game.**
- **NFT Integration**: Spiral enhances the utility and value of interoperable NFTs within the ecosystem, creating a richer gameplay experience and fostering cross-game collaboration.
