# Tokenomics: The Economic Engine of the Cosmicrafts DAO

The **Spiral token** isnâ€™t just a currencyâ€”itâ€™s the beating heart of the Cosmicrafts DAO. Every Spiral token empowers you to shape the franchiseâ€™s future, from decision-making to economic rewards, while connecting every player, investor, and builder across the Cosmicrafts universe. Designed for scalability and sustainability on the [Internet Computer (ICP)](https://internetcomputer.org), Spiral fuels governance, gameplay, and economic incentives across the ecosystem.

![Token Allocation Pie Chart - Placeholder](tokenomics-piechart.webp)

| **Allocation**          | **Percentage** | **Details**                                                                                         | **Rationale**                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Community Treasury**   | **50%**        | Managed by the DAO for development, marketing, partnerships, staking rewards, and initiatives.      | Grants the community direct control over project direction and ensures resources for sustainable development and expansion.       |
| **Decentralization Sale**| **20%**        | Public sale to promote participation and allocate proceeds to the Community Fund.                    | Promotes wide distribution, strengthens network security, and provides initial capital for DAO operations.                       |
| **Team**                 | **10%**        | Vesting over 4 years (1-year cliff, linear thereafter).                                             | Aligns team incentives with long-term project success, driving continued development and innovation.                              |
| **DFINITY Foundation**   | **10%**        | Recognizing ICPâ€™s foundational support, with a 2-year lockup.                                       | Reinforces commitment to the Internet Computer ecosystem and acknowledges its pivotal technological role.                         |
| **Seed Round Investors** | **10%**        | Rewards early supporters with a 1-year lockup period.                                               | Recognizes and rewards early believers who took on greater risk. The lockup period ensures their continued support during the initial stages. |

## Revenue Streams Supporting Treasury Growth

To ensure sustainable treasury growth, Spiral leverages multiple revenue streams:

- **In-game purchases**: Skins, upgrades, and seasonal Battle Pass access.  
- **NFT sales and marketplace commissions**.  
- **Transaction fees**: A percentage of transactions (e.g., 2%) is burned, ensuring deflationary mechanics.  
- **Cross-ecosystem integrations**: Partnerships with Web3 projects to expand Spiralâ€™s utility.  
- **Liquidity rewards**: DEX trading and liquidity incentives.
- **Cosmicrafts DAO** may pursue additional revenue sources, including grants, venture capital initiatives, or partnerships to strengthen long-term treasury sustainability.

## Spiral Utility: Driving Engagement and Ecosystem Growth

### Governance: Empowering Stakeholders  
- **Proposal Submission**: Stakeholders propose updates, features, and policies with a small Spiral deposit to deter spam.  
- **Voting Power**: Voting weight increases with staked Spiral, neuron age (duration), and dissolve delay (commitment period).  
- **Governance Rewards**: Participants earn Spiral tokens for voting, fostering consistent engagement and contribution.

---

### In-Game Economy: Enhancing Player Experience  
Spiral drives the in-game economy, connecting players across the Cosmicrafts franchise:  

- **Discounts**: Use Spiral for a **10% discount** on spaceship upgrades, skins, and more.  
- **Battle Pass Access**: Unlock seasonal rewards, rare cosmetics, and limited-time event participation.  
- **Guild Upgrades**: Expand player-owned guilds, unlocking shared bonuses, faster progression, and competitive advantages.  
- **Unified Franchise Economy**: Shared currency across all games enhances interoperability and utility.  

---

### DeFi Integration: Expanding Economic Opportunities  
- **Trading and Liquidity**: Spiral will trade on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), with rewards for liquidity providers.  
- **Cross-Staking Partnerships**: Holders can stake Spiral in partnered ecosystems to earn additional rewards.  

---

## Tokenomics Mechanisms: Ensuring Long-Term Value  

### Deflationary Mechanics  
To maintain scarcity and long-term value:  

- **Burning Fees**: 2% of in-game purchases and transaction fees will be burned.  
  **Example**: *For a 100 Spiral transaction, 2 Spiral tokens are removed from circulation forever.*  

---

### Staking and Rewards  
- **Non-Minting Rewards**: Rewards are sourced from the Community Treasury, avoiding inflationary pressure.  
- **Maturity-Based Rewards**: Long-term stakers receive greater rewards, incentivizing sustained commitment.

---

### Interoperable Ecosystem  
- **Cross-Game Functionality**: Example: *A spaceship NFT earned in one Cosmicrafts game provides speed boosts in another.*  
- **NFT Integration**: Spiral enhances the utility of interoperable NFTs, connecting assets across the ecosystem.

## Metrics for Success  

To track Spiral's adoption and ecosystem growth, the DAO will monitor:  

- **Percentage of Spiral tokens staked**.  
- **Treasury balance and growth rate**.  
- **Token burn rate**: Projected annual reduction of 5% of total supply.  
- **Governance participation rate**: Active proposals and voting engagement.  
- **ADSS/PA**: Average Daily Spiral Spending per Active Player, measuring real-time in-game token adoption.

---

## Addressing Risks and Challenges  

- **Whale Control**: Dynamic voting caps and diminishing voting power beyond a threshold.  
- **Voter Apathy**: Incentives for participation, reputation-based voting boosts, and gamified leaderboards.  
- **System Exploits**: Bug bounty programs and iterative DAO governance ensure system integrity.

To make Spiralâ€™s utility and flow tangible, the following visuals will be included:  

1. **Token Allocation Pie Chart**: Visualizing the percentage breakdown of token distribution.  
2. **Token Flow Diagram**: Mapping Spiralâ€™s journey from acquisition â†’ staking â†’ rewards â†’ burning.
