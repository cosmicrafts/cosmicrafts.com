**Cosmicrafts DAO** represents a groundbreaking shift in governance, empowering stakeholders to take an active role in shaping the future of a **Web3 gaming franchise**. Built entirely on the **Internet Computer**, the DAO is designed to leverage the scalability, security, and innovation of blockchain technology.

**Cosmicrafts is more than a game** â€” it's an expanding franchise. With a growing base of interconnected games, smart contracts and assets, the DAO provides stakeholders with unparalleled opportunities for governance, rewards, and ownership. By combining cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure with engaging gameplay, Cosmicrafts aims to bridge the gap between traditional and Web3 gaming.

## Why DAO?

The transition to a DAO structure aligns with our vision of decentralization and community-driven growth. Through the DAO, stakeholders can:
- **Shape the future** of Cosmicrafts by voting on key decisions like treasury allocation and project priorities.
- **Benefit economically** from staking rewards, marketplace fees, and a deflationary token economy.
- **Own a legacy**, not just a game, as we build an interconnected franchise that redefines Web3 gaming.

This whitepaper outlines the core features, architecture, and governance of the Cosmicrafts DAO, as well as the value it brings to stakeholders and the Internet Computer ecosystem.
