# Treasury Management: Fueling the Future of Cosmicrafts

The **Community Treasury** is what fuels Cosmicrafts' growth, giving us the resources to build amazing things, innovate, and make sure the ecosystem thrives for years to come. With 50% of all Spiral tokens allocated to the treasury, it’s the largest single funding source for everything from game development to staking rewards.

Managed through the **Service Nervous System (SNS)**, the treasury is fully transparent and controlled by the DAO. That means the community owns the treasury and—not a single person or team—calls the shots.

## Here's How We’ll Manage the Treasury

Here's how we'll make sure the treasury is managed responsibly and effectively:

### You’re in charge
Every decision about the treasury goes through the DAO. You propose, you vote, you decide.

### Open books
Every penny spent, every allocation made—it’s all recorded on the blockchain for everyone to see. You’ll never have to wonder where the funds are going.

### We’re keeping track
If someone proposes to use treasury funds, they’ll need to lay out a clear plan with goals, timelines, and ways to measure success. Regular updates will keep everyone in the loop.

### Built to adapt
The treasury is flexible, so it can meet the DAO’s changing needs. Whether it’s funding new Cosmicrafts games or forming partnerships to expand the ecosystem, the treasury is ready.

### Safe and sound
Your funds are stored in an **SNS ledger canister**, protected by secure code and strict governance rules. No one can access the funds without DAO approval.

## How It Works: Treasury Governance

Have an idea that could boost the Cosmicrafts ecosystem? It all starts with a community proposal. Here’s the process:

### Step 1: Submit a Proposal
As a Spiral token holder, you can submit a proposal to use treasury funds. Make sure your proposal includes:

- **Purpose**: What’s the idea? Why does it matter?
- **Budget**: How much funding do you need, and what will you spend it on?
- **Impact**: How will this help the Cosmicrafts ecosystem?
- **Success Metrics**: How will we know it worked?

A small Spiral deposit is required to submit your proposal. If the proposal is valid but doesn’t pass, the deposit is typically refunded. This discourages spam while keeping the system fair.

### Step 2: Review and Feedback
Everyone can review, ask questions, and suggest improvements to your proposal. This ensures that only the best ideas move forward.

### Step 3: Voting
Next up: voting! Spiral holders stake their tokens in **neurons** to participate. Voting power is based on:

- **Staked Spiral**: The more Spiral you’ve locked up, the more weight your vote carries.
- **Neuron Age**: The longer you’ve been staking, the more voting power you gain.
- **Dissolve Delay**: If you commit to locking your Spiral for longer, your vote counts even more.

Proposals are approved when they meet the required voting threshold (like a simple or supermajority, depending on the rules).

### Step 4: Implementation
If the community votes yes, the SNS automatically releases the funds. No middleman, no delays. The proposal creator then puts the plan into action, with progress updates to keep everyone informed.

## What’s the Treasury For?

The Community Treasury funds the initiatives that will take Cosmicrafts to the next level. Here’s how it’s used:

### 1. Building Games
- Developing new games for the Cosmicrafts franchise, such as a mobile companion app or a new genre spin-off.
- Adding updates and expansions to existing games, like new campaign levels or seasonal events.
- Creating cross-game features like interoperable NFTs that can be used across different Cosmicrafts titles, or a shared in-game currency.

### 2. Growing the Ecosystem
- Partnering with other projects in the Web3 space to bring new features and integrations.
- Running targeted marketing campaigns on social media and gaming platforms to attract new players and investors.
- Supporting community-led initiatives, like esports tournaments, fan art contests, or grants for community developers to create tools and mods.

### 3. Rewarding Stakeholders
- Rewarding Spiral holders for their participation and long-term commitment to the DAO. 
- Providing incentives for long-term commitment through **maturity-based rewards**, where rewards increase the longer tokens are staked.

### 4. Staying Secure
- Investing in technical upgrades, like smart contract audits and enhanced security features.
- Building user-friendly tools and dashboards that provide clear visualizations of treasury spending, proposal status, and voting results.

## Safeguards: Keeping the Treasury Safe

Managing a large treasury comes with big responsibilities. Here’s how we’re protecting your funds:

### Community-driven decisions
No one person can decide how the treasury is used. Every spending decision has to be approved by the DAO through voting.

### Full transparency
Every transaction is recorded on-chain, so you can always see where the money is going. We’ll also share regular reports to keep you up to date.

### Spam prevention
A small Spiral deposit is required for proposals, which discourages spam while making sure serious ideas get heard.

### Emergency reserves
We’re setting aside a portion of the treasury for emergencies, like fixing critical bugs or handling unexpected challenges. These funds can only be accessed through expedited votes.
