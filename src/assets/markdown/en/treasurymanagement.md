# Treasury Management

The DAO treasury is the lifeblood of its operations, ensuring the sustainability and growth of the project. Effective treasury management is critical to balancing innovation, stability, and community engagement.

## Purpose of the Treasury
The treasury exists to support the DAO’s objectives by funding initiatives, rewarding contributors, and ensuring long-term sustainability. It serves several key purposes:
- **Development and Innovation**: Supporting product development, research, and technological advancements.  
- **Marketing and Partnerships**: Funding campaigns, partnerships, and community-building efforts to expand Cosmicrafts’ reach.  
- **Staking and Rewards**: Allocating Spiral rewards for active participants and incentivizing governance engagement.  
- **Reserves for Market Stability**: Maintaining liquidity to stabilize the token’s market value during critical events.  
- **Operational Costs**: Covering legal, administrative, and other essential operational expenses.


### Governance Over Treasury Management
The DAO governs the treasury to ensure transparency, inclusivity, and accountability. Treasury management is guided by the following principles:

- **Proposal-Driven Allocation**:  
  Any allocation or expenditure of treasury funds requires an approved proposal.  
  - Proposals must outline the purpose, amount requested, and expected outcomes.  
  - The DAO reviews and votes on each proposal before implementation.

- **Community Oversight**:  
  Treasury activities are monitored by the community, ensuring decisions align with the DAO’s principles and goals. Regular updates and reports are shared with members to maintain transparency.  

- **Strategic Reserves**:  
  A portion of the treasury is reserved for unforeseen circumstances or high-impact opportunities. Access to these reserves requires supermajority approval by the DAO.

### Voting and Decision-Making
Treasury-related proposals follow a structured process to ensure fair decision-making:
1. **Public Review**:  
   The community discusses the proposal during a public review period to refine and assess its viability.   
2. **Proposal Submission**:
   Stakeholders submit a detailed proposal, including the requested amount, justification, and benefits to the DAO. 
3. **Voting**:  
   Spiral holders vote on the proposal. The weight of each vote is determined by the staked tokens in the neuron.  
4. **Implementation**:  
   Approved proposals are executed, with funds released from the treasury to the specified initiative.

### Sustainability Measures
To ensure the long-term health of the treasury:
- **Revenue Streams**:  
  The DAO continuously generates revenue through game transactions, NFTs, marketplace fees, and staking rewards.  
- **Controlled Spending**:  
  Expenditures are prioritized based on the potential return on investment and alignment with the DAO’s mission.  
- **Periodic Audits**:  
  Regular audits are conducted to evaluate treasury performance, ensuring funds are utilized effectively and transparently.


### Emergency Protocols
In case of emergencies, such as market instability or urgent funding needs:
- The DAO may bypass the standard proposal process for immediate action, requiring supermajority approval.  
- Emergency expenditures are strictly documented and reported to the community.  


> Treasury management ensures the DAO operates efficiently, transparently, and sustainably by empowering the community to oversee and govern the treasure.

The **Community Treasury** is what fuels Cosmicrafts' growth, giving us the resources to build amazing things, innovate, and make sure the ecosystem thrives for years to come. With 50% of all Spiral tokens allocated to the treasury, it’s the largest single funding source for everything from game development to staking rewards.

Managed through the **Service Nervous System (SNS)**, the treasury is fully transparent and controlled by the DAO. That means the community owns the treasury and—not a single person or team—calls the shots.

## How It Works

Have an idea that could boost the Cosmicrafts ecosystem? It all starts with a community proposal. Here’s the process:

### Step 1: Submit a Proposal
As a Spiral token holder, you can submit a proposal to use treasury funds. Make sure your proposal includes:

- **Purpose**: What’s the idea? Why does it matter?
- **Budget**: How much funding do you need, and what will you spend it on?
- **Impact**: How will this help the Cosmicrafts ecosystem?
- **Success Metrics**: How will we know it worked?

A small Spiral deposit from your Neuron is required to submit your proposal. This discourages spam while keeping the system fair.

### Step 2: Review and Feedback
Everyone can review, ask questions, and suggest improvements to your proposal. This ensures that only the best ideas move forward.

### Step 3: Voting
Next up: voting! Spiral holders stake their tokens in **neurons** to participate. Voting power is based on:

- **Staked Spiral**: The more Spiral you’ve locked up, the more weight your vote carries.
- **Neuron Age**: The longer you’ve been staking, the more voting power you gain.
- **Dissolve Delay**: If you commit to locking your Spiral for longer, your vote counts even more.

Proposals are approved when they meet the required voting threshold (like a simple or supermajority, depending on the rules).

### Step 4: Implementation
If the community votes yes, the SNS automatically releases the funds. No middleman, no delays. The proposal creator then puts the plan into action, with progress updates to keep everyone informed.

## What’s the Treasury For?

The Community Treasury funds the initiatives that will take Cosmicrafts to the next level. Here’s how it’s used:

### 1. Building Games
- Developing new games for the Cosmicrafts franchise, such as a mobile companion app or a new genre spin-off.
- Adding updates and expansions to existing games, like new campaign levels or seasonal events.
- Creating cross-game features like interoperable NFTs that can be used across different Cosmicrafts titles, or a shared in-game currency.

### 2. Growing the Ecosystem
- Partnering with other projects in the Web3 space to bring new features and integrations.
- Running targeted marketing campaigns on social media and gaming platforms to attract new players and investors.
- Supporting community-led initiatives, like esports tournaments, fan art contests, or grants for community developers to create tools and mods.

### 3. Rewarding Stakeholders
- Rewarding Spiral holders for their participation and long-term commitment to the DAO. 
- Providing incentives for long-term commitment through **maturity-based rewards**, where rewards increase the longer tokens are staked.

### 4. Staying Secure
- Investing in technical upgrades, like smart contract audits and enhanced security features.
- Building user-friendly tools and dashboards that provide clear visualizations of treasury spending, proposal status, and voting results.

## Safeguards: Keeping the Treasury Safe

Managing a large treasury comes with big responsibilities. Here’s how we’re protecting your funds:

### Community-driven decisions
No one person can decide how the treasury is used. Every spending decision has to be approved by the DAO through voting.

### Full transparency
Every transaction is recorded on-chain, so you can always see where the money is going. We’ll also share regular reports to keep you up to date.

### Spam prevention
A small Spiral deposit is required for proposals, which discourages spam while making sure serious ideas get heard.

### Emergency reserves
We’re setting aside a portion of the treasury for emergencies, like fixing critical bugs or handling unexpected challenges. These funds can only be accessed through expedited votes.
