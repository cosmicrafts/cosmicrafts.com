## The Opportunity

The gaming industry is at a turning point, and the need for innovation has never been clearer:
1. **Challenges in Traditional Gaming**:
   - **Crowded Market**: Dominated by [legacy franchises](https://a16zgames.substack.com/p/data-deep-dive-what-are-the-zoomers), it's [increasingly difficult](https://www.statista.com/statistics/552623/number-games-released-steam) for new projects to stand out.
   - **Over-Monetization**: Has pushed players away, [frustrated](https://www.tekedia.com/web3-gaming-has-an-identity-problem/) by [Play-to-Earn](https://cointelegraph.com/news/play-to-earn-is-out-challenge-and-earn-is-the-next-major-trend-in-web3-gaming) and [Pay-to-win](https://techloved.com/mobile-games/) models and other [predatory practices](https://www.axios.com/2021/11/16/xbox-exploitive-nft-gaming-projects).
2. **Web3 Gaming Failures**:
   - **Misplaced Priorities**: Too many Web3 games focus on [speculative asset trading](https://cointelegraph.com/innovation-circle/embracing-the-shift-in-web3-gaming-from-play-to-earn-to-play-and-earn) instead gameplay.
   - **Low Quality**: Many projects [fail to deliver](https://nftplazas.com/web3-hype-and-quality/) the polish and depth expected by mainstream gamers.
   - **Community Skepticism**: Web3 is often seen as a [space for scams](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/19/web3-gaming-investor-survey/) rather than meaningful innovation.


## The Solution

Let’s keep it real—most projects claim to be “unique,” but we know execution is what matters. Here’s why Cosmicrafts delivers where others don’t:

1. **A Polished Product, Ready to Scale**
   Most Web3 projects are either concepts or unfinished prototypes. Cosmicrafts isn’t. This is a live, polished game with fully developed mechanics, engaging gameplay, and years of iteration behind it. It’s about showing it to more players and scaling up. The groundwork is done, and now it’s about expansion.

2. **No Blockchain Complexity**  
   No need for wallets, pay for transactions or technical know-how to play. It’s Web3, but it feels just like Web2 for the user. Built on the Internet Computer, Cosmicrafts brings players the kind of polished games they’re used to—without the complexities of blockchain gaming.

3. **Evolving Assets That Mean Something**
   In Cosmicrafts, assets like NFTs don’t stay static—they evolve. Smart contracts on the Internet Computer allow asset metadata to change without losing history. A spaceship you upgrade retains its record, its story, and its evolution. It’s a level of innovation unique to Cosmicrafts.

4. **DAO-Driven Growth for ICP**
   The DAO is all about growth. You’re stepping into a role that directly shapes **how we grow this franchise**, from deciding how to reach new players to driving campaigns that make a real impact, the focus is on strategies that deliver results. And for ICP stakeholders, this is a unique way to show what the Internet Computer can achieve by putting its strengths front and center in a live project.

5. **Real Utility, Backed by Strong Economics** 
   The Spiral token connects gameplay with economic systems in ways familiar to players of traditional games. Microtransactions, upgrades, and in-game purchases feel natural and intuitive—just like they would in any top-tier game. The difference? It’s all tied to the ICP ecosystem where stakeholders benefit, creating an alignment of incentives that Web2 can’t offer.

> This is your moment to be part of scaling something extraordinary. The DAO isn’t asking for help to finish the product—it’s inviting you to take a role in its success.

## The Power of Stakeholders

Joining the Cosmicrafts DAO is about being the owner of brand, a franchise that's designed to expand, evolve, and reward those who help shape its future.  This is where your investment translates into real influence and tangible returns.

1. **Building a Legacy Together**:
  When you join the DAO, you’re becoming part of its foundation. Stakeholders hold a real piece of Cosmicrafts, designed to appreciate over time while offering tangible benefits along the way.
   - **Real Ownership**: Stakeholders own a piece of the franchise, owning a luxury asset that not only appreciates in value but also pays dividends.
   - **Real Power**: Governance rights ensure stakeholders have a direct say in key decisions, such as hiring, firing, and treasury allocations.

2. **Economic Rewards**:
  The success of Cosmicrafts directly generate significant returns for its stakeholders. The DAO treasury captures revenue from various streams, creating a system that rewards active participation and commitment.
   - **Revenue That Flows Back to You**: Microtransactions, NFT sales, Ad revenue and other income sources, flow back to the DAO treasury, which directly benefits stakeholders.
   - **Staking Spiral for Passive Income**: Lock your Spiral tokens and earn interest along with dividends from the treasury, the more the franchise grows, the more you earn.

3. **Sustainable Tokenomics**:
The Spiral token is the engine of this franchise. It's designed for utility, from in-game purchases to governance power. And with built-in deflationary mechanisms, we're focused on a sustainable economy and long-term value, not short-term gains.
   - **Real Utility**: Use Spiral for purchases, upgrades, and governance decisions. It’s the backbone of the entire franchise.
   - **Deflationary Mechanisms**: We don’t mint more tokens. Instead, transaction fees burn Spiral, reducing supply and increasing demand over time.
