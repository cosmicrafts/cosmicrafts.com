# Proposal Lifecycle & Community Involvement

The Cosmicrafts DAO thrives on its community. Whether it’s a bold idea for a new game mode, a partnership with another project, or a fresh way to grow the ecosystem, you can bring those ideas to life by submitting a proposal to the DAO. Here’s how the process works:

## Proposal Creation: Turning Ideas into Action

Every great proposal starts with a conversation. Before formally submitting your idea, we encourage you to share it with the community in dedicated discussion channels. This early feedback helps refine your proposal, address potential concerns, and increase its chances of success.

### Who can propose?
Any Spiral token holder with a staked neuron can submit a proposal.

### What should your proposal include?

A strong proposal should clearly outline:

- **The Problem**: What issue or opportunity are you addressing? (Clearly define the challenge or potential benefit.)
- **Your Solution**: What’s your idea to solve the problem or capitalize on the opportunity? (Describe your proposed solution in detail.)
- **The Plan**: What steps are needed to make it happen? (Outline the key steps and milestones for implementation.)
- **Timeline**: How long will it take? (Provide a realistic timeframe for each stage of the project.)
- **Budget (if applicable)**: How much funding is required, and how will it be used? (Provide a detailed breakdown of expenses.)
- **Team (if applicable)**: Who will be responsible for carrying out the proposal? (List the individuals or teams involved and their roles.)

> **Tip:** Present your information clearly and concisely to ensure the community can easily understand and evaluate your proposal.

## Community Debate: Collaborative Refinement

Once you’ve submitted your proposal, it’s time for the community to get involved. Through dedicated channels on our Discord server, threads on the official Cosmicrafts forum, and regular AMAs, everyone can review, ask questions, and offer suggestions for improvement. 

Here’s how the community collaborates to refine each proposal:
- **Feedback**: Stakeholders provide constructive feedback to improve the proposal.
- **Debate**: Discussions address potential challenges and highlight opportunities.
- **Iteration**: Proposal creators can refine their ideas based on community input.

This collaborative process ensures proposals are thoroughly reviewed and optimized before voting begins.

## Voting: Empowering the Community

Once the community debate concludes, it’s time to vote! Spiral holders stake their tokens in neurons to participate. Your voting power is weighted based on:

- **Staked Spiral**: The number of Spiral tokens locked in your neuron.
- **Dissolve Delay**: The longer you commit to locking your tokens, the greater your influence.
- **Neuron Age**: Long-term supporters gain additional influence over time.

Each of these factors contributes to your total voting power using a predefined formula (e.g., an example formula could be `(Staked Spiral x 1) + (Dissolve Delay x 0.5) + (Neuron Age x 0.2)`). The exact formula will be publicly available and subject to DAO governance.

Approved proposals are automatically executed by the SNS, ensuring transparency and tamper-proof implementation.

## Implementation, Accountability, and Community Evaluation

### Making it Happen
Once the community gives the green light, it’s time to put the plan into action. For simpler proposals, like treasury fund transfers, the SNS automatically handles execution. For more complex initiatives, progress updates are provided regularly, and key milestones are tracked on-chain to ensure transparency and accountability.

### Tracking Success
The community evaluates the results based on the goals and metrics outlined in the proposal. Examples of metrics include:
- Increased player engagement (e.g., daily/monthly active users).
- Growth in the Spiral token holder community.
- Completion status of key milestones.
- ROI for treasury-funded initiatives.

This feedback loop ensures the DAO continuously learns and improves its decision-making processes.

## What’s the Proposal Lifecycle For?

The proposal lifecycle isn’t just about approving ideas—it’s about building Cosmicrafts together. Here’s what it enables:
1. **Innovation**: Empowering community members to propose and implement creative ideas.
2. **Collaboration**: Encouraging open discussion and debate to refine proposals.
3. **Accountability**: Ensuring that every approved proposal delivers tangible value to the ecosystem.
