## Why Stake Spiral Tokens?

Staking Spiral tokens is your gateway to deeper involvement in the DAO and a way to earn meaningful rewards. Here’s why staking matters:

- **Earn Rewards**: Stake Spiral and earn rewards for your contribution to the DAO.
- **Boost Voting Power**: Locking your Spiral in neurons boosts your voting power, giving you a bigger say in how the DAO is run.
- **Support the Ecosystem**: Staking strengthens the treasury, stabilizes the Spiral token, and fuels the development of new projects.
- **Unlock Exclusive Perks**: As a staker, you'll unlock perks like early access to new games and content, special NFT drops, and more.

## Staking Your Spiral and Earning Rewards

Staking your Spiral is simple and rewarding. Here’s how it works:

### Staking Your Spiral

Using the DAO’s governance interface, you can lock your Spiral tokens into a neuron. You’ll also choose a “dissolve delay”—the length of time you commit to locking your tokens. The longer the delay, the greater your rewards and voting power.

### How Your Neuron Grows

Over time, your neuron accumulates voting power based on three key factors:

1. **Staked Spiral**: The more Spiral you’ve locked up, the more weight your vote carries.
2. **Neuron Age**: The longer you’ve been staking, the more voting power you gain.
3. **Dissolve Delay**: Committing to a longer dissolve delay boosts your voting power even further.

This accumulated voting power directly translates to higher governance rewards when you participate in DAO proposals.

### Earning Rewards

As a Spiral staker, you can earn rewards in several ways:

1. **Governance Rewards**:  
   Every time you vote on a proposal, you’ll earn Spiral tokens. The more voting power your neuron has, the more you’ll earn.

2. **Maturity-Based Bonuses**:  
   The longer you stake your Spiral, the bigger your bonus rewards become. For example:  
   - **1 Year:** +5% bonus on top of your base rewards.  
   - **2 Years:** +12% bonus on top of your base rewards.  
   - **3+ Years:** Up to +20% bonus on top of your base rewards.  
   These amounts are examples and are subject to DAO governance.

3. **Exclusive Perks**:  
   Staking unlocks exclusive perks like early access to new Cosmicrafts games and content, special NFT drops, and more.

4. **Deflationary Benefits**:  
   A portion of transaction fees from in-game purchases is distributed to active stakers, creating additional revenue streams.

## Safeguards for Staking

To protect stakers and ensure long-term sustainability, the DAO employs several safeguards:

- **Anti-Whale Measures**:  
  Limits on maximum voting power per neuron prevent centralization and ensure fair participation.

- **Penalty for Early Dissolving**:  
  Stakers who dissolve their neurons early lose a portion of accumulated rewards. This penalty discourages short-term speculation and incentivizes long-term commitment, which is crucial for the stability and growth of the DAO.

- **Fair Distribution**:  
  Rewards are funded from the Community Treasury, ensuring no new tokens are minted for staking payouts, maintaining the token’s value.

## How It Supports the Ecosystem

Staking Spiral doesn’t just benefit individual stakers—it drives the entire Cosmicrafts ecosystem forward:

- **Treasury Growth**:  
  When you stake Spiral, you help strengthen the treasury, giving the DAO more resources to fund exciting new projects.

- **Token Stability**:  
  Locking up Spiral helps stabilize the token’s value and reduces market volatility.

- **Community Engagement**:  
  Staking encourages active participation in governance, ensuring a vibrant and committed community.
