## 2. Functional NFTs

Cosmicrafts NFTs go beyond aesthetics and speculation, providing real utility within the game and across the franchise.

### Key NFT Types
1. **Characters and Units**: Unique heroes and playable units with customizable abilities that enhance gameplay.
2. **Skins and Avatars**: Personalize player profiles and in-game appearances.
3. **Chests and Souls**: Facilitate player progression by transferring metadata (e.g., stats, experience) between NFTs.
4. **Items and Equipment**: Weapons, armor, and shields that can be upgraded and traded.
5. **Cosmetic Enhancements**: Decorative items for characters, units, and the game's user interface.

### Interoperability
- **ICP Native Integration**: NFTs are optimized for the Internet Computer's zero-fee transaction model, ensuring a non-technical experience for players.
- **Future Compatibility**: While interoperability with other blockchains is technically feasible through [Chain Fusion](https://internetcomputer.org/chainfusion), ICP's advantages (e.g., free and fast transactions) make it the preferred ecosystem.

### Utility-First Design
- **In-Game Use Cases**: NFTs unlock missions, boost stats, and provide access to exclusive areas.
- **Evolving Assets**: Players can upgrade and evolve NFTs over time, ensuring continuous engagement and value.

## 3. Spiral Token Utility

The **Spiral token** is the backbone of Cosmicrafts' economy, offering versatility for both stakeholders and players.

### Dual Use Cases
1. **Governance**:
   - Spiral tokens grant stakeholders voting power within the DAO, enabling them to shape the franchise's future.
   - Decisions on treasury allocation, new features, and game expansions reflect collective input.
2. **Microtransactions**:
   - Players use Spiral tokens for in-game purchases, benefiting from lower transaction fees compared to fiat or stablecoins.

### Deflationary Design
- **Burning Mechanisms**: A portion of transaction fees is burned, reducing the token supply over time.
- **Non-Minting Staking Rewards**: Unlike inflationary systems, staking rewards come from pre-allocated pools, preserving the deflationary nature of the token.

### Long-Term Value
- **Sustainable Growth**: The Spiral token aligns stakeholder rewards with the franchise's success.
- **Economic Differentiation**: The deflationary model ensures token scarcity, driving appreciation as demand grows.
