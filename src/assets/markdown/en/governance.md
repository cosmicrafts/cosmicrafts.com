# Governance

## Introduction

We’ve designed governance to put the community at the center, giving Stakeholders a real say in how the franchise grows. Built using ICP's native [SNS (Service Nervous System)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/overview), maintained by the [DFINITY Foundation](https://dfinity.org/), the DAO uses fairness, transparency, and community-driven decision-making to ensure Cosmicrafts stays true to its vision.

## How Governance Works

The Cosmicrafts DAO leverages the Internet Computer's [SNS (Service Nervous System)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/overview) framework, enabling robust and transparent decentralized governance and treasury management. Here's how it works:

### Decentralized Governance
- The DAO empowers stakeholders by granting them voting rights to shape the project's future. 
- Decisions include:
  - Allocation of treasury funds to initiatives like marketing, game development, or partnerships.
  - Establishing economic policies such as tokenomics adjustments, staking rates, and fee structures.
  - Prioritization of development milestones to align with the community's vision.
- Voting is conducted through the [NNS (Network Nervous System)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/overview), an intuitive interface, making governance accessible to all token holders.

### Maturity-Based Staking
- **Neuron Staking**: Stakeholders lock tokens in [neurons](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/neurons/neuron-overview) to participate in governance and earn rewards.
  - The longer tokens are staked, the greater the maturity of the neuron, directly impacting:
    - **Voting Power**: Higher maturity grants greater influence in governance decisions.
    - **Rewards**: Maturity-based staking provides [compounding returns](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/neurons/staking-voting-rewards), incentivizing long-term commitment.
  - Neuron holders can [dissolve neurons to unlock tokens](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/neurons/neuron-management), with dissolving durations adjustable to balance liquidity and governance participation.
- **Governance Participation Rewards**: Active participation in proposals and voting enhances individual rewards, promoting engagement within the community.

### Proposal Submission

Got an idea for a new feature, partnership, or treasury adjustment? Here’s how to turn your idea into action within the Cosmicrafts DAO.


#### **1. Public Discussion**
We encourage stakeholders to start with a **public discussion** about their proposal. This step helps refine ideas, gather community feedback, and increase the chances of success.  
- Use our dedicated **forum** to present your concept, share details, and receive constructive input from the community.  
- For **critical decisions** that require immediate review, proposals can bypass this step but must clearly justify the urgency.  

#### **2. Submitting Your Proposal**
Once your idea has been validated through community discussion, it’s time to submit your proposal.  
- **Clear and Detailed Submission**:  
  Proposals must include:  
  - A clear and concise description.  
  - The rationale behind the idea.  
  - Expected outcomes and benefits to the DAO.  
- **Team Assistance**:  
   If your proposal has been validated but you face challenges submitting it, the team can help elaborate and submit it on your behalf, covering the proposal fee.

#### **3. Community Voting**
Once live, Spiral holders vote on your proposal.  
- **Neuron Voting Power**:  
  The weight of each vote is determined by the staked Spiral tokens in the voter’s neuron.  
- **Engagement Incentives**:  
  If your proposal passes, it’s automatically implemented by the SNS, and you may earn Spiral rewards as recognition for your contribution to the DAO.  



## Treasury Management

The Cosmicrafts DAO treasury is the lifeblood of its operations, ensuring the sustainability and growth of the project. Effective treasury management is critical to balancing innovation, stability, and community engagement.

### Purpose of the Treasury
The treasury exists to support the DAO’s objectives by funding initiatives, rewarding contributors, and ensuring long-term sustainability. It serves several key purposes:
- **Development and Innovation**: Supporting product development, research, and technological advancements.  
- **Marketing and Partnerships**: Funding campaigns, partnerships, and community-building efforts to expand Cosmicrafts’ reach.  
- **Staking and Rewards**: Allocating Spiral rewards for active participants and incentivizing governance engagement.  
- **Reserves for Market Stability**: Maintaining liquidity to stabilize the token’s market value during critical events.  
- **Operational Costs**: Covering legal, administrative, and other essential operational expenses.


### Governance Over Treasury Management
The DAO governs the treasury to ensure transparency, inclusivity, and accountability. Treasury management is guided by the following principles:

- **Proposal-Driven Allocation**:  
  Any allocation or expenditure of treasury funds requires an approved proposal.  
  - Proposals must outline the purpose, amount requested, and expected outcomes.  
  - The DAO reviews and votes on each proposal before implementation.

- **Community Oversight**:  
  Treasury activities are monitored by the community, ensuring decisions align with the DAO’s principles and goals. Regular updates and reports are shared with members to maintain transparency.  

- **Strategic Reserves**:  
  A portion of the treasury is reserved for unforeseen circumstances or high-impact opportunities. Access to these reserves requires supermajority approval by the DAO.

### Voting and Decision-Making
Treasury-related proposals follow a structured process to ensure fair decision-making:
1. **Public Review**:  
   The community discusses the proposal during a public review period to refine and assess its viability.   
2. **Proposal Submission**:
   Stakeholders submit a detailed proposal, including the requested amount, justification, and benefits to the DAO. 
3. **Voting**:  
   Spiral holders vote on the proposal. The weight of each vote is determined by the staked tokens in the neuron.  
4. **Implementation**:  
   Approved proposals are executed, with funds released from the treasury to the specified initiative.

### Sustainability Measures
To ensure the long-term health of the treasury:
- **Revenue Streams**:  
  The DAO continuously generates revenue through game transactions, NFTs, marketplace fees, and staking rewards.  
- **Controlled Spending**:  
  Expenditures are prioritized based on the potential return on investment and alignment with the DAO’s mission.  
- **Periodic Audits**:  
  Regular audits are conducted to evaluate treasury performance, ensuring funds are utilized effectively and transparently.


### Emergency Protocols
In case of emergencies, such as market instability or urgent funding needs:
- The DAO may bypass the standard proposal process for immediate action, requiring supermajority approval.  
- Emergency expenditures are strictly documented and reported to the community.  


> Treasury management ensures the DAO operates efficiently, transparently, and sustainably by empowering the community to oversee and govern the treasure.

- DAO oversight ensures accountability without interfering in operational independence.
- Transparent reporting and defined boundaries maintain trust between the foundation and the DAO.

### Team Voting Protocol for the DAO

The Cosmicrafts Foundation team holds significant voting power in the DAO, but this power is designed to amplify the community’s voice, not override it. The protocol ensures that team votes are principled, timely, and aligned with the DAO’s long-term success.

#### **1. Amplifying Community Consensus**
- **Majority Support**:  
  If the majority of the community supports a proposal **and** it aligns with the DAO’s General Principles, the team will cast their votes in favor of the proposal.  
  - This ensures the team acts as an amplifier of community consensus, respecting the collective decision-making process.

#### **2. Timely Participation**
- **Clear Stance**:  
  The team will participate in voting within a predetermined timeframe, avoiding last-minute decisions.  
  - This transparency allows the community to see where the team stands and promotes trust.  

#### **3. Principle-Based Opposition**
- **Aligned with Core Principles**:  
  If the team believes a proposal fundamentally contradicts the DAO’s principles, they reserve the right to vote against it.  
  - **Documentation**: Any NO vote by the team will be thoroughly documented, with a clear explanation made publicly available for review and discussion.  
  - **Engagement**: The team will encourage dialogue within the DAO community to ensure decisions are understood and collaboratively addressed.  

#### **4. Roadmap Alignment**
- **Unanimous Support for Roadmap Proposals**:  
  Proposals that align with the DAO’s established Road Map will automatically receive full support from the team.  
  - This reflects the commitment to the original vision and ensures the Road Map is executed effectively.  

#### **5. Limits to Team Power**
- **Safeguarding, Not Controlling**:  
  The team’s voting power is substantial but exists to safeguard the DAO’s interests, not to dominate decision-making.  
  - **Temporary Influence**: As 2% of the team’s tokens gradually dissolve over an 8-year period, their voting power will shift increasingly to community stakeholders.  
  - **Community-Centric**: The team’s role is to act as stewards of the DAO, facilitating its growth while empowering the broader community to take ownership over time.  

#### **6. Transparency and Accountability**
- **Public Voting Records**:  
  The team’s voting decisions will be documented and shared publicly to ensure transparency and foster trust.  
- **Regular Updates**: The team will provide periodic updates on their voting rationale, aligning their actions with the DAO’s goals and values.  

> By setting clear boundaries and principles, this protocol guarantees that decisions are made transparently and in the best interest of Cosmicrafts and its stakeholders.
