# Governance: Command the Cosmicrafts DAO

## Introduction

In the Cosmicrafts DAO, **you hold the reins**. We’ve designed governance to put the community at the center, giving everyone with Spiral tokens a real say in how the franchise grows. Built on the Internet Computer’s **Service Nervous System (SNS)**, the DAO uses fairness, transparency, and community-driven decision-making to ensure Cosmicrafts stays true to its vision.

## Core Principles within the SNS Framework

These are the core values that guide how we govern Cosmicrafts:

- **Decentralization:** No single entity runs the show. Power is distributed among the community.
- **Community Ownership:** Every Spiral token you hold gives you a voice in the DAO’s future.
- **Inclusivity and Fairness:** Whether you’re new to the DAO or a longtime supporter, the system ensures your voice matters.
- **Transparency:** Every proposal, vote, and decision is recorded on the blockchain for everyone to see.
- **Long-Term Commitment:** The longer you stay involved, the more your influence grows. It’s our way of rewarding loyalty and dedication.

## How Governance Works

So, how do you actually call the shots in Cosmicrafts DAO? Here’s how it works:

### Neurons: Your Key to Voting Power
To participate, you lock up Spiral tokens in what we call a "neuron." Think of it as your personal voting booth—your direct line to influencing the future of Cosmicrafts. Your voting power depends on three things:

- **How much Spiral you lock up:** More tokens = more power.
- **How long you lock it up for:** The longer the lock (called the “dissolve delay”), the more weight your vote carries.
- **How long you’ve been part of the DAO:** The longer your neuron has been active, the more influence it gains. We call this “neuron age.”

### Proposal Submission
Got an idea for a new feature or partnership? Want to suggest changes to the treasury? Here’s how you get started:

1. **Submit your proposal:** You’ll need to stake a small Spiral fee to avoid spam.
2. **Outline your plan:** Proposals should include clear details, a rationale, and expected outcomes.
3. **Time for the community to give their feedback:** Proposals go through a public review period where everyone can share thoughts and suggest improvements.

### Voting and Rewards
Once a proposal is live, Spiral holders vote. Your neuron’s voting power determines the weight of your vote. If your proposal passes, it’s automatically implemented by the SNS, and you may earn Spiral rewards as a thank-you for contributing.

## Treasury Management: Investing in the Future

The DAO’s **treasury** is the lifeblood of Cosmicrafts’ growth. Holding 50% of all Spiral tokens, it’s used to fund development, marketing, partnerships, and staking rewards. Proposals on how to spend treasury funds go through the same voting process as everything else, ensuring **you** decide how resources are used.

## Decentralization Roadmap

We believe decentralization is a journey, not a switch you flip. Here’s how we’re handing more control to the community over time:

1. **Early Days:** To keep things stable, the core team retains voting influence through team-controlled neurons.
2. **Transition Phase:** Over time, the team steps back, dissolving their neurons or reducing their influence. This gives the community more control.
3. **Fully Decentralized:** Eventually, the community holds the reins entirely. All major decisions come from Spiral holders like you.
