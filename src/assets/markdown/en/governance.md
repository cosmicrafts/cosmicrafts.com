# Governance: Command the Cosmicrafts DAO

## Introduction

In the Cosmicrafts DAO, **you hold the reins**. We’ve designed governance to put the community at the center, giving everyone with Spiral tokens a real say in how the franchise grows. Built on the Internet Computer’s **Service Nervous System (SNS)**, the DAO uses fairness, transparency, and community-driven decision-making to ensure Cosmicrafts stays true to its vision.

- **SNS and DAO Integration**:
  - The DAO is built using ICP's native [SNS (Service Nervous System)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/overview), maintained by the [DFINITY Foundation](https://dfinity.org/), with secure governance and treasury management.

## Core Principles within the SNS Framework

These are the core values that guide how we govern Cosmicrafts:

- **Decentralization:** No single entity runs the show. Power is distributed among the community.
- **Community Ownership:** Every Spiral token you hold gives you a voice in the DAO’s future.
- **Inclusivity and Fairness:** Whether you’re new to the DAO or a longtime supporter, the system ensures your voice matters.
- **Transparency:** Every proposal, vote, and decision is recorded on the blockchain for everyone to see.
- **Long-Term Commitment:** The longer you stay involved, the more your influence grows. It’s our way of rewarding loyalty and dedication.

## How Governance Works

So, how do you actually call the shots in Cosmicrafts DAO? Here’s how it works:

### Neurons: Your Key to Voting Power
To participate, you lock up Spiral tokens in what we call a "neuron." Think of it as your personal voting booth—your direct line to influencing the future of Cosmicrafts. Your voting power depends on three things:

- **How much Spiral you lock up:** More tokens = more power.
- **How long you lock it up for:** The longer the lock (called the “dissolve delay”), the more weight your vote carries.
- **How long you’ve been part of the DAO:** The longer your neuron has been active, the more influence it gains. We call this “neuron age.”

### Proposal Submission
Got an idea for a new feature or partnership? Want to suggest changes to the treasury? Here’s how you get started:

1. **Submit your proposal:** You’ll need to stake a small Spiral fee to avoid spam.
2. **Outline your plan:** Proposals should include clear details, a rationale, and expected outcomes.
3. **Time for the community to give their feedback:** Proposals go through a public review period where everyone can share thoughts and suggest improvements.

### Voting and Rewards
Once a proposal is live, Spiral holders vote. Your neuron’s voting power determines the weight of your vote. If your proposal passes, it’s automatically implemented by the SNS, and you may earn Spiral rewards as a thank-you for contributing.

## Treasury Management: Investing in the Future

The DAO’s **treasury** is the lifeblood of Cosmicrafts’ growth. Holding 50% of all Spiral tokens, it’s used to fund development, marketing, partnerships, and staking rewards. Proposals on how to spend treasury funds go through the same voting process as everything else, ensuring **you** decide how resources are used.

## Decentralization Roadmap

We believe decentralization is a journey, not a switch you flip. Here’s how we’re handing more control to the community over time:

1. **Early Days:** To keep things stable, the core team retains voting influence through team-controlled neurons.
2. **Transition Phase:** Over time, the team steps back, dissolving their neurons or reducing their influence. This gives the community more control.
3. **Fully Decentralized:** Eventually, the community holds the reins entirely. All major decisions come from Spiral holders like you.

## Governance and Treasury

The Cosmicrafts DAO leverages the Internet Computer's [SNS (Service Nervous System)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/overview) framework, enabling robust and transparent decentralized governance and treasury management. Here's how it works:

### **Decentralized Governance**
- The DAO empowers stakeholders by granting them voting rights to shape the project's future. 
- Decisions include:
  - Allocation of treasury funds to initiatives like marketing, game development, or partnerships.
  - Establishing economic policies such as tokenomics adjustments, staking rates, and fee structures.
  - Prioritization of development milestones to align with the community's vision.
- Voting is conducted through the [NNS (Network Nervous System)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/overview), an intuitive interface, making governance accessible to all token holders.

### **Treasury Management**
- Funds are managed transparently and securely via smart contracts, ensuring:
  - **Immutable Records**: Every action taken by the DAO is recorded on-chain for complete transparency.
  - **Fair Distribution**: Allocation of funds is determined through community voting, preventing centralized control.
  - **Sustainability**: Mechanisms like deflationary tokenomics and staking rewards contribute to long-term ecosystem growth.
- The treasury is also staked in [Neurons](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/neurons/neuron-overview), earning rewards that feed back into the DAO to support ongoing and future initiatives.

### **Maturity-Based Staking**
- **Neuron Staking**: Stakeholders lock tokens in [neurons](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/neurons/neuron-overview) to participate in governance and earn rewards.
  - The longer tokens are staked, the greater the maturity of the neuron, directly impacting:
    - **Voting Power**: Higher maturity grants greater influence in governance decisions.
    - **Rewards**: Maturity-based staking provides [compounding returns](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/neurons/staking-voting-rewards), incentivizing long-term commitment.
  - Neuron holders can [dissolve neurons to unlock tokens](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/neurons/neuron-management), with dissolving durations adjustable to balance liquidity and governance participation.
- **Governance Participation Rewards**: Active participation in proposals and voting enhances individual rewards, promoting engagement within the community.

### **SNS and NNS Integration**
- The SNS framework integrates seamlessly with the Internet Computer's **NNS (Network Nervous System)**, leveraging its:
  - Proven track record in secure, decentralized governance.
  - Scalable and cost-effective infrastructure, supporting a large number of stakeholders.
  - Advanced staking and reward mechanisms to incentivize both economic and governance participation.

### **Vision for the Treasury**
- The treasury acts as the lifeblood of the DAO, enabling:
  - Funding for ecosystem expansion, including new games and features.
  - Support for partnerships that drive adoption and value for the franchise.
  - Long-term growth through reinvestment in the ICP ecosystem.
- Transparency and community-driven decisions ensure alignment with stakeholder interests, fostering trust and collaboration.
